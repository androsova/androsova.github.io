What is a biomarker?

A short and clear definition is given by <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/biomarker?s=t">Dictionary.com</a>: 
"Biomarker is a naturally occurring molecule, gene, or characteristic by which a particular 
pathological or physiological process, disease, etc. can be identified." 
In other words, it is a biological feature that can answer, if you have a disease or pone to have one.

The article below focuses on the delirium and cognitive decline that occurs in elderly patients
after surgery. We aimed to summarise the up-to-date knowledge on the known biomarkers of postoperative 
delirium (POD) and cognitive dysfunction (POCD).
